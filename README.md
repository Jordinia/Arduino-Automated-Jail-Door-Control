# Arduino-Automated-Jail-Door-Control

1. Introduction to the Problem and Solution

The traditional way of jail door handling is often lacking in terms of automation, security, and efficiency which are crucial for creating an ideal environment for prisoners and prison staffs. Operation of jail doors by human labor is vulnerable to error and needs more effort and time than actually needed. Realizing the problem, we decided to dedicate our project to solve said problem by implementing an Arduino-centric design whcih includes master-slave configurations, buttons, an LCD with serial communication protocols, motors, and others. The objective is to maximize security and efficiency while providing some information about the status of the jail doors in real-time.

Automation with Arduino is meant as a solution to the challenges introduced by the old mechanism of jail door handling. The challenges are eliminating delays and inefficiencies that may affect the workflow inside the prison, increasing monitoring and security capabilities bys showing jail doors' status in real-time, and also maintaining the health and safety of prisoners and staffs.

The old door handling mechanism is full of limitations. By developing this solution, we aim the increase productivity, security, and efficiency in terms of general operations inside prisons.
